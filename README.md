# COVID-19 Vaccination Analysis: Afghanistan, India, and Kenya

## Project Description
Comparative analysis of vaccination rollout efficiency, coverage disparities, and key challenges across three countries during the pandemic (2021-2023). This project investigates:
- Vaccination timeline patterns
- Gender and regional disparities
- Dose utilization efficiency
- Policy impact assessment

## Objectives
1. Compare vaccination rollout speed and coverage between conflict-affected (Afghanistan), high-population (India), and developing (Kenya) contexts
2. Identify systemic barriers (e.g., Afghanistan's gender gap, Kenya's stagnation)
3. Analyze correlations between vaccination rates and mortality metrics
4. Generate actionable policy recommendations

## Tools & Libraries
python using a jupyter working area
- Core Libraries:
  ```bash
  pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, zipfile
  
Data Source: Our World in Data


How to Run
Prerequisites:

Key Insights
Vaccination Performance
Country	Full Vaccination (%)	Doses/100 People	Efficiency
India	67.2	102	60.8%
Afghanistan	44.7	85	9.4%
Kenya	20.5	52	23.1%
Critical Findings
Afghanistan:

300% vaccination surge post-regime change (Aug 2021)

Extreme gender disparity (25% urban vs <5% rural female vaccination)

India:

Sustained 1.5% monthly coverage growth

Digital infrastructure (CoWIN) enabled high efficiency

Kenya:

Unexplained 12% coverage plateau

No correlation with supply chain issues

Recommendations
For Afghanistan:

Female vaccinator training programs

Mobile clinics for rural areas

For Kenya:

Hesitancy surveys in urban hotspots

Cold chain monitoring systems

Cross-Learning:

Adopt India's digital tracking best practices

Regional knowledge-sharing networks

Reflections
Data Limitations: Missing provincial data for India/Kenya, incomplete excess mortality metrics

Surprises: Kenya's stagnation despite stable supply chain

Future Work: Incorporate socioeconomic factors (GDP, healthcare access)
